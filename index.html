                    <p>Digital marketing can be the most cost effective way to promote your community, as well as a way to gain
                        followers. Your website can improve your groups credibility and reputation.</p>
                    <p>A website allows you to grow your community with a direct way for interested people to sign up for your
                        information, as a volunteer, or to make a direct donation to your organisation.</p>
                    <p>Your website can be a constently updated source of information for your members and help you reach them
                        quickly and easily. I also offer digital newsletters, a quick and easy way to stay in touch with
                        your community and members. </p>
